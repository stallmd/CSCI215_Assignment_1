<h2>Information and Resources</h2>
<p> Most of the images can come directly from my book directly. All of the text will mostly be the description and synopsis of my book. For the about pages I will add autobiographical and biographical information attained by an interview with my illustrator. I might need to find graphics to add as much of a playful look to the website as possible. Graphics that do not come from my book will come from permitable sources. I will also give credit and links to how people can help bring awareness and research to pediatric cancer from sites such as St.Jude, Victory Junction, Ronald McDonald, etc.</p>
