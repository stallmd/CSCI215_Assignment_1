<h1> Summary </h1>
<hr>
<p> Jake Dash is the main character, who resembles a child going through chemo therapy and is competing in the National Pro Championship. His top competitor in the race is a boy named Luke Kemia. During the race, Jake is head to head with Luke, but then grabs the lead at one point. However, during a break in the race, while Jake has stepped away from his car, Luke sneaks over and pours carcinomas gas in Jakes engine. This has terrible effects to Jake's car as he starts to race again, so much so that Jake has to come back to the Pit Stop for his crew leader Doc to asses the problem. Doc quickly figures it out and fixes it with a chemical called ChemoPro. With the support from his pit crew, family, and fans Jake is then able to get back on the track and catch up to win the race. Let's go Jake Dash!

<h1> Inspiration </h1>
<hr>
<p> The idea of <i>The Race of a Lifetime</i> was created to help inspire children battling pediatric cancer. In efforts to parallel a popular childhood figure to the journey of a child with Leukemia, the story takes basic principles of the cancerous disease and creates symbols and metaphors to represent different concepts of Leukemia and its treatment process. <i>The Race of a Lifetime</i> is meant to spread awareness and courage for children battling cancer.
