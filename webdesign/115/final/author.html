<h2> Mackenzie Stall </h2>
<p> Mackenzie Stall was born in Summerville, South Carolina and grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina. She attends the College of Charleston and is majoring in Computer Information Systems. Mackenzie originally came up with the idea for <i> The Race of A Life Time </i> while she was daydreaming off in her high school Chemistry class. Once the idea came into her head, she couldn't get it out. She completed the manuscript writing of the book for her senior project in high school. Knowing she wanted this book to spread and inspire as many children possible that are battling pediatric cancer, Mackenzie sought an illustrator at the college to help her bring the characters to life. Soon Mackenzie hopes to develop more plot lines for future stories that will parallel other childhood cancers.
