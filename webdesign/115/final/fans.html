<p> The fans include everyone in the stands- including you reading! Without the support from his fans, Jake Dash would not have been willing to start back in the Extremist Pro race after Luke Kemia had almost eliminated Jake's chances of winning. The fans help keep Jake motivated and his morale high! Jake loves and adores his fans because he knows he wouldn't be the racecar driver he is today without them cheering him on every step of the way.</p>
