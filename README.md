* Create a folder in your personal CofC webspace called portfolio.
* Inside of portfolio, create an **index.html** landing page which has a responsive design using the \<header\>, \<nav\>, \<section\>, \<footer\> special HTML5 divs. 
  * The index.html is a landing page for your portfolio of CofC work. 
  * The \<header\> area should have your name (you can omit last name if you like), degree, expected graduation date, professional/career goals/interests. A professional headshot type picture should be to the left of this text, and when the screen resolution is phone-size, the text should go below neatly.
   * The \<nav\> div should have links to the HOME page (index.html) and at least 3 courses you want to showcase in your portfolio.
      * One of these must be CSCI 215 Website Programming
      * Write out the entire name of the course along with prefix and course number. 
   * The \<section\> tag on index.html should just have some text about the CSCI program you are in at CofC, your experiences, etc. 
    * The \<footer\> should have links to the CSCI and the CofC homepages. Put your email address here in the following sneaky format: kbriggsATcofcDOTedu
* Each one of your divs must have at least 3 CSS styles attributes assignments associate with them. All styles should be located in mainstyle.css.
    * You are not allowed to use any packaged templates although you can get color combinations ideas from http://www.colorcombos.com/. You must come up with all the styles yourself. **You are not allow to use any type of WYSIWYG software in this assignment. All html/CSS must be written from scratch in Webstorm or similar editor.** 
* For each one of the courses in your portfolio create a sub folder named csci215, etc. Inside of each of these folder should be an html file identical to the parent index.hml, but the section should include the course’s course description, a link to a pdf of the syllabus for the course, and anything else you want to say about the course. 
    * In your csci215 folder’s index.html, go ahead and include an Assignment 1 link to the pdf of this assignment.
    * For the other courses, you need to have at least 3 links to assignments that you have completed. These should include source code if applicable. If you want to include a course in which you are current enrolled, then just put placeholder inactive links for these assignments for now and upload them as the semester goes along.
